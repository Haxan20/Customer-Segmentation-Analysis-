# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-📉📊📈
Customer Segmentation analysis was done using real world datasets from kaggle 
# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project demonstrates a common unsupervised learning technique for grouping customers into distinct segments based on their characteristics (e.g., spending, demographics).

## Overview

The project uses the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to identify patterns in customer data. The optimal number of segments (`k`) was determined by calculating the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** and using the **Elbow Method** to find the point of diminishing returns.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
*   **K-Means Clustering** from `scikit-learn`
*   **Data Standardization** (e.g., StandardScaler)
*   **Elbow Method** for determining optimal `k`
*   **PCA** for visualization (optional)

## 📚 Educational Purpose
This project is intended **strictly for educational purposes**. It serves as a learning tool for understanding clustering algorithms, feature engineering, and the interpretation of unsupervised learning results in a marketing context.
